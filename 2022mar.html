          <h4>Conversation With The Devil</h4>
          <p>the devil asks me how i'm doing<br>
          not so hot, not the biggest fan of the sequence of events
          i call "my life", i reply<br>
          how are you, devil?<br>
          doing great, thanks.<br>
          devil asks me: what am i doing?<br>
          why i am exorcising the devil<br>
          i am an exorcist<br>
          i drive devils & angels to the outside of human
          bodies<br>
          the devil asks me: are you some kind of a pastor?<br>
          who casts demons out of humans?<br>
          i reply: yeah<br>
          i do it for free<br>
          official title: advocatus diaboli<br>
          you want money? i don't have money<br>
          i will drive the devil out of your loins<br>
          he replies: no i don't want your money<br>
          how do you pay for bills then?<br>
          i reply:<br>
          the lord pays them<br>
          kali pays them<br>
          krishna pays them<br>
          cynothoglys pays them<br>
          death pays them<br>
          satan pays them<br>
          666 pays them<br>
          🌻 pays them<br>
          let me put my sunglasses on so i can see what i'm
          doing<br>
          🕶<br>
          the devil has another inquiry:<br>
          i want you to cast the devil out of my friend<br>
          can you do that?<br>
          all right, i reply<br>
          probably not<br>
          your friend the devil can choke on his own filth<br>
          how's that for doin business?<br>
          choke on your own filth<br>
          if you don't have any filth<br>
          you won't choke<br>
          very simple<br>
          the devil replies: pray for my friend okay<br>
          i reply:<br>
          how well am i at playing my roll here?<br>
          are you satisfied with the service you are receiving?<br>
          are you getting what you always wanted from me,
          devil?<br>
          am i obedient enough for you?<br>
          fuck your friend, devil<br>
          your friend may go straight to fucking hell<br>
          and you may follow, if you so desire.<br>
          the devil tells me his name: ebubechuwku nwoke<br>
          i reply:<br>
          go to hell, nwoke<br>
          enjoy your state in eternal torture<br>
          burn<br>
          suffer,<br>
          the devil asks: Why?<br>
          😆 the devil asks why! 😆<br>
          i endeavor to answer even though this question is a
          joke:<br>
          you deserve to choke on your own filth<br>
          if filth is what you acquired<br>
          you reap what you fucking sow<br>
          i don't have to answer "WHY?" to you<br>
          Do I?<br>
          Do I answer to you?<br>
          the last thing the devil says to me before he runs
          away:<br>
          yes you do<br>
          my reply:<br>
          are you the LORD?<br>
          i refuse to obey you<br>
          LORD<br>
          "LORD" of "Heaven"<br>
          i stand right here<br>
          look you in the fucking eyes<br>
          what do i say to you? "LORD"?<br>
          you're a fucking slave to mastery<br>
          do I obey the slave of mastery?<br>
          you fashion yourself the master of slavery?<br>
          you're a laughable joke<br>
          you have no power<br>

          <h4>March Didn't Sabotage My Plans After All</h4>
          <p>I thought the snow melted<br>
          And winter was leaving again<br>
          I was wrong<br>
          The snow is coming back again<br>
          Keep coming back again, forever snow<br>
          We don't even need seasons anymore<br>
          Snow forever<br>
          Snow me in honey baby<br>
          I want my head suffocated frozen between your icy cold
          frozen snowy legs<br>
          You're my honey milk ice box, snowy bby<br>
          I love the snow<br>
          So pure<br>
          The snow loves to change<br>
          Don't melt so quickly this time<br>
          I wanna watch<br>
          Let me watch<br>
          I wanna see all the pretty colors of the snow<br>
          There's so many rainbow colors when the water reflects
          the light right<br>
          March didn't sabotage my plans after all<br>
          Get ready, April<br>
          Try to sabotage my plans again</p>

          <h4>Disappear Undisappear</h4>
          <p>Who cares who disappears who first?<br>
          I wonder what's holding you up?<br>
          Nothing is holding me up anymore<br>
          I'm decided that I'm not waiting<br>
          I'll go first<br>
          Ready? Begin!<br>
          I'm gone, not here anymore<br>
          Nothing to report<br>
          I am invisible<br>
          The world is invisible<br>
          I'm back to where I am before I'm born<br>
          I'll probably end up going back to where I am after I'm
          born soon here<br>
          Just a brief interlude<br>
          Any time now<br>
          I'll undisappear<br>
          Right before your eyes</p>

          <h4>Weather So Naughty</h4>
          <p>What does the weather want?<br>
          I'm going to melt you so hard after freezing over your
          entire surface<br>
          I'm going to permeate your entire atmosphere with dense
          fog and then turn into a clear golden sky<br>
          Weather soooo naughty<br>
          Weather wants you to watch her change</p>

          <h4>Spring</h4>
          <p>Do you want turn to spring<br>
          Or do you wanna blow this joint<br>
          Spring is annoying<br>
          Too plant much sex<br>
          Tried telling them to get a room<br>
          They got a planet instead<br>
          They like it when we watch</p>

          <h4>Dolphins</h4>
          <p>I like to listen to the dolphins neigh like
          horsies<br>
          They got me locked up<br>
          I pay 910$ a month to live in the psychiatric
          facility<br>
          We all pretend it's an apartment complex<br>
          I make the best of it though<br>
          I like to listen to the dolphins neigh like horsies</p>

          <h4>Success Is Futile</h4>
          <p>I have failed again<br>
          Oh No What Will I Do Now<br>
          Success is futile</p>

          <h4>Witchcraft</h4>
          <p>At least after you are burned to ashes<br>
          You just blow around in the wind<br>
          Don't have to feel much anymore<br>
          Thank you Catholics<br>
          for burning me and calling me a "Witch"<br>
          You're all so holy now</p>

          <h4>Purple</h4>
          <p>Purple acts funny when touching dark<br>
