          <h4>The Police Murdered Elijah</h4>
          <p>The police murdered Elijah<br>
          The police are being charged with murder<br>
          The police say the police being charged is "hysterical
          overreaction"<br>
          The police are frightened and crying for mommy and daddy
          to save them.<br>
          Elijah reminds them too much of Malcom<br>
          <br>
          Initiating police brain activity scan program<br>
          <br>

          Police brain activity scan result data:<br>
          <br>
          So we had to kill him and try to sweep it under the rug,
          see?<br>
          He was extremely threatening because he played the violin
          for cats at the animal shelter<br>
          We had to shove ketamine down his throat because we
          feared for our safety, we experience his mouth and mental
          activity as a deadly weapon so we had to shut him up<br>
          He was having a mental health crisis, he was very
          mentally ill, and we the police, did the job the Romans
          pay us to<br>
          He appeared to us to be imminently extremely dangerous to
          our persons, so we took the logical course of action<br>
          He was gravely disabled, so you shouldn't care that much
          about him being dead anyways, please just forget about
          this and continue on with your lives? Please? I'm begging
          you mommy and daddy or I'll start crying! Please do this
          for me! You love the police! You love the blue!<br>
          <br>
          We, the police, really need to make sure he stays
          dead<br>
          We're really scared his bones will crawl out of his
          grave<br>
          Take up his fiddle and start playing again<br>
          We made sure and burned his bones to ash<br>
          He's probably never coming back again, right?</p>

          <h4>Cute Poison Apple</h4>
          <p>There was a child named Zane<br>
          The government let the land get "contaminated"<br>
          They "forgot"<br>
          They made lots of money!<br>
          A flood happened<br>
          The water had lots of carbon & nitrogen<br>
          The flood spawned a tidal wave of Hydrogen Cyanide<br>
          And killed the child named Zane Gbangbola<br>
          The government says that's unfortunate<br>
          But they need to keep making money off the land<br>
          Even if it means the tidal wave comes back<br>
          Are you excited for the great flood?<br>
          Hydrogen Cyanide is lighter than air</p>

          <h4>Home</h4>
          <p>I'm going back to Titan<br>
          Turning the Saturn Sun back on<br>
          Blowing all you earthlings away<br>
          I'll bring an ark powered by whales<br>
          With all my favorite animals<br>
          I'll see you in Hell<br>
          While I'll see me in Heaven</p>

          <h4>Whale Pact</h4>
          <p>Whales move and go mooooo<br>
          Sea horseys go yee haw octopus cowboy<br>
          <br>
          Whale brains dream:<br>
          What's life like<br>
          On the other side<br>
          Of the surface tension?<br>
          How my blow hole yearns<br>
          To flop freely in pure O2<br>
          Let's blow this H<br>
          <br>
          The Orcas formed a pact in Whale Tongue<br>
          We won't eat the humans<br>
          Unless we get locked up in human named "sea world"<br>
          Then that's different</p>
