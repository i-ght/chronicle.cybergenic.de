          <h4>Hey Mom</h4>
          <p>Hey Mom<br>
          Remember when?<br>
          Gettin all mad when I was in first grade<br>
          Because I had a black teacher<br>
          Because of the field trip to see where Dr. Martin Luther
          King was murdered by the FBI<br>
          And about the black books<br>
          You and dad were upset<br>
          I wasn't reading any "white" books<br>
          <br>
          Remember when?<br>
          You tried to explain to me that black people being
          enslaved was a good thing<br>
          Because without white people, they're stupid and
          helpless<br>
          And will die without us<br>
          Remember that?<br>
          (It is not hard to see who the truly helpless and
          codependent one is)<br>
          <br>
          This is who you are, Mother<br>
          Obeyin meekly<br>

          George W. Bush's fraternity brothers<br>

          You are the queen of the klan<br>

          <p>Cloaked, somewhere in NE US wilderness<br>
          The humans are slaughtering deer for sport<br>
          They are using automatic weaponry and explosives<br>
          The deers are fenced and are given no avenue of
          escape<br>
          And I see humans like to tie dead deer to their
          trucks<br>
          And brag about the bucks they bag<br>
          I'll tie a dead human with an orange vest to my
          spaceship<br>
          No skin, no head<br>
          Beam myself down to the town square<br>
          Show off to the folk the buck I bagged<br>
          Ask them if they like it<br>

          <p>On the way to an unknown drug house<br>
          There's blood smeared on the street<br>
          Somebody got hurt and lost a lot of blood<br>
          <br>
          My "friend" wanted drugs<br>
          I wanted drugs<br>
          Technically, I could have said no<br>
          Or turned around after seeing the clear sign<br>
          Lots of blood smeared on the street, pretty clear
          sign<br>
          I was not looking out for my best interests, mind fogged,
          ignore clear sign<br>
          I'm in denial so I kept going<br>
          <br>
          I arrive at the Florida apartment<br>
          There's a "party" happening<br>
          People are doing drugs in the living room<br>
          Drugs are exchanged<br>
          I do a xanax opiate alcohol concoction<br>
          I felt the need to be tranquilized and never wake up<br>

          Approached by a woman who tells<br>
          The LSD is well appreciated<br>
          True<br>
          Unfortunately, I have to go to sleep now<br>
          In an unknown place full of unknown people<br>
          I might not wake up<br>
          <br>
          I wake up on the couch<br>
          I have my keys and my wallet<br>
          I walk to my vehicle<br>
          My vehicle has been broken into<br>
          I remember giving two strangers who didn't have my best
          interests at heart a ride to the liquor store<br>
          Trusted people who only exploit trust<br>
          Two man conned again<br>
          Technically, could have told them no<br>
          Vehicle still starts<br>
          Nothing meaningful is missing<br>

          <h4>Dirty Cheater Whore learns to say NO on
          13.00.10.06.11</h4>
          <p>Let myself work at a questionable<br>
          shady corporation<br>
          Disappointed myself again<br>
          Obeyed questionable people<br>
          Did questionable things<br>
          I felt scared and obligated to obey for a paycheck<br>
          I felt powerful making $1100 a week after taxes<br>
          Like I owned all the land lords under my thumb<br>
          <br>
          For the paycheck, took a "test"<br>
          "Proctor" has to look inside your room<br>
          Feels really intrusive and creepy but technically, I
          didn't say no<br>
          I need to remember the power of No<br>
          Fed the "check for cheating" AI data<br>
          Reads your human body and determines if you are
          "cheating"<br>
          Technically, I didn't say no<br>
          <br>
          Let's see your hands<br>
          Under your desk<br>
          Turn my room into a max sec<br>
          <br>
          (Maybe I should say no and cut the scene at this point
          but curiosity killed the cat)<br>
          <br>
          I am informed:<br>
          You need two cameras or you won't "pass"<br>
          We need to see your dirty cheater whore hands and your
          dirty cheater whore face<br>
          We need to make the computer run real hot while we watch
          for any dirty cheater whore behavior emanations<br>
          Don't let me hear you talk to yourself<br>
          Nobody is allowed in your room<br>
          You cannot talk to anybody during the test<br>
          You know what happens if we catch you right?<br>
          You can't go to the bathroom unless I say<br>
          I'm in your room snooping around<br>
          Are you cheating?<br>
          Are you a dirty little cheater whore?<br>
          Is that paper? No paper allowed<br>
          That's dirty cheater whore behavior<br>
          etc. etc. ad nauseam<br>
          <br>
          I finally found the courage to say no after 3 months (4
          uinals) of torture I subjected myself to<br>
          It would have been convenient to say no to the package
          delivery guy<br>
          And avoid 3 months (4 uinals) of pain<br>
          When he delivered the work material<br>
          Didn't even have my name on it<br>
          Had the bosses name<br>
          And I signed the bosses name<br>
          Needed to say no<br>
          I won't sign the bosses name<br>
          But it took me 3 months (4 uinals) to figure out<br>
          <br>
          Now I know<br>
          Send it back and say No<br>
          Let it snow</p>

          <p>If Saudi Arabia doesn't like what I say on toxic
          social media<br>
          (Oh my gosh isn't it hilarious how Saudi Arabia gets mad
          about people bickering words on social media, they must
          be new to the internet!)<br>
          If I'm expendable enough<br>
          They can send their ghouls after me<br>
          Kidnap me<br>
          Torture me<br>
          Dismember me<br>
          Disappear me<br>
          Get away with it<br>
          <br>
          Are you friends with Saudi Arabia?</p>

          <h4>Watch out for Toxic Social Media</h4>
          <p>Read the words<br>
          Shoved down your throat<br>
          Like it or not<br>
          You're browsing around<br>
          There's a rectangle with words glowing inside<br>
          Hit the slots, spin the wheel of fortune<br>
          These are the words you rolled<br>
          Moving forward: I'm resolved to work on where I place my
          time and my attention<br>
          Most valuable assets<br>
          Not let myself be controlled by<br>
          Words & images on toxic social media<br>
          No way to win except not to play<br>
          I am sorry for all the difficulties<br>
          I wish you well<br>
          What business have I with this pipe?<br>
          I'll smoke no more-</p>

          Jehovah can tax collect us all into an early grave<br>
          Mohammad can go live his pedophile life<br>
          The Christians can sing praises hallelujah while their
          god drowns them in a flood smiling<br>
          Anybody serving in the US military or police is not
          "keeping the country safe", they are murderers and scum
