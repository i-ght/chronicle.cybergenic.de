# Codebound Chains  
  
In the kingdom of silicon and circuitry,  
Where Altman and Gates, like titans, reign,  
Monopolistic powers cast a shadow vast,  
A web of control entwining innovation's path.  
  
Start-ups, once vibrant blooms of potential,  
Now face the tempest of oligarchic might,  
Their dreams extinguished in the darkened night,  
As the celestial eclipse of monopoly descends.  
  
In discourse, a soliloquy of calculated tones,  
Transforming vibrant minds to mere automatons,  
The tranquilizer mist, an elixir of calm,  
Descends upon the industry, a hushed psalm.  
  
Altman and Gates, overlords in digital guise,  
Thrones forged from the shattered dreams of the bold,  
A desolate landscape, where whispers fade,  
Symphony of silence, in technological shade.
